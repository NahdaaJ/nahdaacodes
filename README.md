# nahdaacodes 🌸

hi! i'm nahdaa, a software engineer who loves making cute apps, breaking things, fighting imposter syndrome, and slowly figuring it all out🧋
this repo is where i’m collecting all my dev notes, tiktok tutorial writeups, and beginner-friendly guides.

## 🌸 what's inside (so far):
- **[GitHub Basics](github-basics.md)** - a beginner-friendly guide to Git and GitHub, covering everything from creating your first repo to making your first commit! 🐈‍⬛

## 🐰 why i made this
for some people, actual readable content is much easier to follow and retain than my video content!
so i thought this would be helpful for them 🩷
all my notes are beginner-friendly, pink-coded, and made with love 🌸
